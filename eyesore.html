            <p>The goal of the project was to develop an optical illusion that can be applied in the real world. My illusion becomes more vibrant through movement as well as opacity and color as time goes on. This could be applied as an incentive to reduce screen time, because the more time you spend on your screen, the more of an “eyesore” it becomes. The code is looped in a short timeline for demonstration purposes, but would ideally work on a longer timeframe, increasing based on the amount of hours you used your screen for. </p>
